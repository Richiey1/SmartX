Gig Worker Income Verification
Gig Worker Income Verification

On-chain income credentials for gig workers to access credit, loans, and financial services.

Millions of gig workers earn legitimate income but are denied loans, rentals, and financial services because their income cannot be verified through traditional systems. This platform creates verifiable, cryptographic proof of income using blockchain attestations.

🚀 Problem

Gig workers face systemic financial exclusion:

No W-2 or traditional pay stubs

Banks and lenders cannot verify income

Manual statements are easily falsified

Credit scoring systems ignore gig platforms
